# Product-consumer-statistical-analysis
This work uses surveyed data to uncover categorical interdependencies of consumer buying trends based on the public’s individual responses to a Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE). The analysis will aid to the definition of the organization’s product and service repertoire, as well as determine strategic approaches for the business’ progression. The results will not only determine recommended products and services, but also ways in which the existing products and services can be optimally marketed in certain divisional regions.

# Objectives

Objectives of the following analytical report are as follows:
•	To explore purchasing trends as new products and services are considered
•	To compare the performance of products and services in formulation of bundles 
•	To identify a classification of consumers in pursuit of strategic audience targeting
•	To determine influential regions for future warehouse locations
•	To describe more effective regional marketing campaigns based on the performed analyses 

The overall goal of the analysis is to establish the future of a retailer's product and service availability. Successful and continuous business growth needs for each warehouse’s product and service repertoire to be assessed individually because each caters to a different audience based on their locations and varying consumer audiences. 

# Research Hypotheses
The analysis explores purchasing trends and compare the performance of products and services as the selection of new products and services and pairings of existing products and services its planned. The analysis also identifies consumer categories based on their demographical responses to distinguish the target audience, thus improving the decision making of added products and services. The compilation of the product-based and consumer-based analysis leads to the determination of future locations, product and service availability, and promotion design. Business questions (BQ) and associating null (H0) and alternate (Hα) hypotheses are as follows:
  
• product-based analysis

BQ1: Which consumption category is selling most?

H0: Consumption levels in each category are independent and identically distributed

Hα: Consumption levels in each category can be ranked.

BQ2: Do consumer categories have a significant relation with other consumer categories?

H0: There is no relationship between any products and/or services purchased. 

Hα: There is a relationship between the products and/or services purchased.

• consumer-based analysis

BQ3: Are there existing consumer groups?

H0: Demographics remain consistent for each surveyed answer.

Hα: Demographics are inconsistent for each surveyed answer and thus can be grouped.

• regional analysis

BQ4: Is there a relationship between the location of a customer and the products they purchase?

H0: There is no relationship between a consumer’s location and the products purchased

Hα: There is a relationship between a consumer’s location and the products purchased.

Each analysis is available in the repository on its own, and also as a full code, revealing the ability of running a single code to perform all three analyses with the same graphical output.
